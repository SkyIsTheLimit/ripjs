# REST In Peace - Create REST APIs in Peace [![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/SkyIsTheLimit/ripjs.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/SkyIsTheLimit/ripjs)

This library allows you to quickly spin up REST APIs with the help of a configuration file. To see an example, navigate to the examples/event-log folder. The configuration can be found in the rip.conf.js file and the code to run it is in app.js. 

## Future Scope
1. Create a CLI to manage the main engine.
2. Enable a GUI over the engine.
3. Allow multiple databases to be connected. 
4. Integrate with a AAA scheme.
